# Week 9 Weekend Homework

You made it - you're learning React! For homework this weekend...

1. We've deployed some new readings/codealongs on React. These will start to talk about some Redux patterns, which we'll look at on Monday. 
2. You built an API - awesome work! Now, try to create a React application to hit the API and render out the data. Use the Gif example from class as a guide. Building a project will help solidify the awesome knowledge you've gained.
3. Take a look at the Redux documentation at [http://reduxjs.org/](). Redux is an awesome library to help us manage state in our JS applications. We'll take a deep dive into this on Monday!

Have a great weekend!

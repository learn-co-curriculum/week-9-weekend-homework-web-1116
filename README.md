# Week 9 Weekend Homework

You made it - you're learning React! For homework this weekend...

1. We've deployed some new readings/codealongs on React. These will start to talk about some Redux patterns, which we'll look at on Monday. 
2. You built an API - awesome work! Now, try to create a React application to hit the API and render out the data. Use the Gif example from class as a guide. Building a project will help solidify the awesome knowledge you've gained. Use our lecture repository as a guide. For reference, here are the things you will need to create your project.
  + An index.html file - this should look identical to the one we used. This will load when the server loads. 
  + A .babelrc file to set which presets we're using for when we transpile. 
  + A package.json file to tell npm which packages we depend on. Here, we'll need react, redux, axios (or another library to make web requests) plus some babel packages for transpiling, as well as webpack and webpack-dev-server to bundle up all of our code. 
  + a `webpack.config.js` file to configure how webpack should run. Again, you should be able to copy/pasta this from the lecture code. 
  + Finally, create a `src` directory to hold all of your js files. Here, create a file called `index.js`. Remember to use `import` and `export` statements in your different files. 
3. Take a look at the Redux documentation at [http://redux.js.org/](). Redux is an awesome library to help us manage state in our JS applications. We'll take a deep dive into this on Monday!

Have a great weekend!
